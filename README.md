Hello Everyone,
 
I trust you're all doing well!
 
I'm Excited to introduce my 2nd Project For Afame Technologies focused on Titanic Survival Data Analysis using Power BI.
 
In This Project, I Conducted an Analysis of Titanic Survival Analysis Data encompassing various aspects, Including Total Passenger, Total Died, Passenger Class, Percentage of Survival Rate and more. The Objective was to extract valuable insights and gain meaningful conclusions from the dataset.
 
I hope you find the insights from this project informative and useful
The software used in this project was Power BI, which facilitated data extraction, cleaning, dax Query writing, visualization, and more.
I endeavored to make this data as user-friendly as possible, and I hope you find it insightful. If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to share them with me. 
Thank you!
Software used : Excel, Power bi, PPT
