Hello Everyone,
 
I trust you're all doing well!
 
I'm excited to introduce my latest project focused on Data Analysis using Power BI.
 
In this project, I conducted an analysis of HR analytics data covering various aspects, including employee records, pending promotions, and employee retrenchment. The objective was to extract valuable insights and draw meaningful conclusions from the dataset.
 
I hope you find the insights from this project informative and useful
The software used in this project was Power BI, which facilitated data extraction, cleaning, dax Query writing, visualization, and more.

I endeavored to make this data as user-friendly as possible, and I hope you find it insightful. If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to share them with me. Thank you!
