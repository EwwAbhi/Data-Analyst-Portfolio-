Hello Everyone,
I trust you're all doing well!

I'm excited to introduce my latest project focused on Data Analysis using SQL Server and Power BI.

In this project, I delved into the details of Shark Tank data to extract valuable insights into investments, entrepreneurs, and more. Here's a glimpse of some of the key metrics I calculated:

.Total Episodes
.Pitches Converted
.Total Invested Amount
.Highest Deal Taken
.Average Equity Taken
.Total Males
.Total Females
.Partner Deals
.Count of Episodes each Shark was featured in
.Total Amount Invested and Equity Taken by each Shark

Additionally, I used Power BI to visualize the Shark Tank data, creating user-friendly representations through bar graphs, charts, and cards, among other tools.

The software used for this project includes SQL Server (SSMS) for data extraction and manipulation, and Power BI for visualization.

I endeavored to make this data as user-friendly as possible, and I hope you find it insightful. If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to share them with me. Thank you!

I wasn't able to include all the queries in the project presentation because it would make the PowerPoint much longer and take more time.
